  ## Description:
  I enhanced an existing e-commerce platform called Shop-Shop. I centralized all of the application's data in state globally to make it easier to share state across the entire application. I also created a shopping cart for the application, add offline functionality, and process secure online payments with a service called Stripe. 
  ## Installation:
  Clone repo, open terminal and run `npm run develop`. 
  ## Usage:
  This projects use is for shopping and demonstrating skills such as redux, stripe, react, java, server-side cached, global state, shopping cart UI, and shopping cart persistence.
  ## Testing:
  Open via terminal, run `npm run develop`
